Beancoin is just a clone of SmallChange which is a clone of Litecoin. This coin is created for fun and to learn and experiment. Do not use this for anything serious! :-)

If you want to build the wallet on Ubuntu, do the following:

install dependencies
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install build-essential libboost-all-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libdb5.3-dev libdb5.3++-dev git qt-sdk libminiupnpc-dev libssl-dev

clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/zackedelman/beancoin-live.git

build the wallet
qmake "USE_UPNP=-"

make

add seed nodes (were not included in the source code)
in your home folder in .Funcoin, create Funcoin.conf and add the following:

addnode=95.85.15.176

addnode=95.85.8.14

Note: not guaranteed the nodes will be there :-)
